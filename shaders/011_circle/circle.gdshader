	We define the center position of our circle and then ask each pixel how far from that
	center position it is. This will give the pixel a value between 0 â€“ 1.
	We can then ask the pixel if its value is lower or higher than a predefined value.
	If it is higher we will set the pixel to white
	and if it is lower we will set it to black.
